# Bat-Ray-Buoy-
An oceanographic data buoy containing a sensor to measure the clarity (turbidity) of water and correllate the turbidity with calculated tide levels and display the results on a mobile device.  


The buoy will be deployed in the Encinal Basin. This correllation of tides and turbidity determines the optimal time for viewing bat rays in the Encinal Basin.
