# Overview

An oceanographic (or waterways) data buoy containing a sensor to measure the water clarity (turbidity), correllate the turbidity with tide levels and then display the results on a mobile device.  The buoy will be deployed in the Encinal Basin. This correllation of tides and turbidity determines the optimal time for viewing bat rays in the Encinal Basin. 

# Status
All harwdware is operational (in a prototypeing state) and the software runs the turbidity sensor. Awaiting GSM communications capabilities.

## Hardware List
### enclosure
The enclosure is made of 3 inch schedule 40 PVC pipe and fittings with the exception of the stability ring. There's nothing particular about schedule 40 other than it's the least expensive. You could use schedule 80, or different colored pipe. I've attempted to make the simplest mechanical device, using readily avaiable materials from local (USA) hardware stores. Simplicity of construction with the least number of connections should provide confidence in water tightness. Here's an example of schedule 40 pipe http://www.pvcfittingsonline.com/pipe/schedule-40-pvc-pipe.html. here in the states we can often find it in short lengths (12 to 18 inches) so you don't need to buy a long standard length. 
### Stablilty Ring
My prototype for the stability ring is made from Foamular(tm) rigid insulation, because it's very easy to work with and inexpensive. Eventually I'll 3D print the ring probably out of PLA. Here;s the exact piece of insulation I used that allowed me to cut several rings http://www.homedepot.com/p/Project-Panels-FOAMULAR-1-in-x-2-ft-x-2-ft-R-5-Insulation-Sheathing-PP1/203553730.
