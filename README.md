# Overview

An oceanographic (or waterways) data buoy containing a sensor to measure the water clarity (turbidity), correllate the turbidity with tide levels and then display the results on a mobile device.  The buoy will be deployed in the Encinal Basin. This correllation of tides and turbidity determines the optimal time for viewing bat rays in the Encinal Basin. 

# Status
All harwdware is operational (in a prototypeing state) and the software runs the turbidity sensor. Awaiting GSM communications capabilities.
